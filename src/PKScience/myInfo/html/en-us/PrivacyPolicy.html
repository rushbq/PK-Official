                <p>We use your personal information in order to fulfil our commitment to providing a member service experience. As part of that undertaking, we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of the personal information that we gather. As one of our members, you understand and agree that we collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy for Members (this “Policy”).</p>

            <div class="collapsible-body" style="display: none;">
                <p>This Policy applies to personal information regarding members and the other individuals with whom we do business or who visit us or who register online and to the use of that personal information in any form – whether oral, electronic or written. This Policy gives effect to Prokit’s commitment to protect your personal information and has been adopted by all of the separate and distinct legal entities that manage, own and/or provide services to the Prokit’s branch office or distributors around the world. While this Policy is intended to describe the broadest range of our information processing activities globally, those processing activities may be more limited in some jurisdictions based on the restrictions of their laws. For example, the laws of a particular country may limit the types of personal information we can collect or the manner in which we process that personal information. In those instances, we adjust our internal policies and/or practices to reflect the requirements of local law.</p>

                <p>From time to time, we may disclose your personal information. We would always make that disclosure in accordance with applicable law. Circumstances where we might make such disclosure (in addition to those described in Section 4 above) include:</p>

                        <p>Like most international brands, we may outsource the processing of certain functions and/or information to third parties. We may also engage market research firms to assist us in contacting members for the purpose of market research and quality assurance. When we do outsource the processing of your personal information to third parties or provide your personal information to third party service providers, we oblige those third parties to protect your personal information with appropriate security measures and prohibit them from using your personal information for their own purposes or from disclosing your personal information to others.</p>

                        <p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell hotels and other assets, or cease being the manager or franchisor of a hotel that is currently part of our portfolio. In those circumstances, we may include the personal information collected about you, or control of that personal information, as a business asset in any such transfer. Also, in the unlikely event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, personal information collected from you, or control of such information, may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
