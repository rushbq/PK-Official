    <span class="text-bold">Patent Products, 100% Made in Taiwan</span>
    <br />
    P’ro’sKit Science Kit and Pro’sKit Robot Kit requires 100% DIY, the design of which is much more difficult than finished models in the market. No matter how difficult it is, we still keep providing the unique kit for children to experiment how technology apply and use in our life. What’s more, the connection between family members is much closer through the building process!All Pro’sKit science kit and robot kit have patented and guarantee 100% made in Taiwan. It’s your best choice.

            <li>A gear (or cogwheel) is a rotating machine part having cut teeth, or cogs, which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque. When two gears mesh, if one gear is bigger than the other, a mechanical advantage is produced, with the rotational speeds and the torques of the two gears differing in proportion to their diameters.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>A solar cell is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect, which is a physical and chemical phenomenon. Solar cell goes with gearing empower car to run. Solar cells generally work well with natural sunlight. Since artificial sources of light such as incandescent and fluorescent bulbs mimic the Sun’s spectrum, solar cells can also work indoors. Other artificial sources such as LED and neon lamps have very restricted color spectra; solar cells may not work as effectively with their light.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Hydraulic power is the use of fluids under pressure to generate, control, and transmit power. A hydraulic arm works by using high fluid pressure, created by a pump, to force a piston in a cylinder to move. As a valve is opened one way, the fluid is allowed to enter the cylinder and force the piston to move.</li>
